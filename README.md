## Abstract Substrate ETH RPC Adapter

Allows any Substrate chain to expose familiar ETH RPC without making any changes in the protocol level. The adapter supports the most essential ETH RPC calls and makes Substrate chains compatible with EVM development tools. More info about the project can be found in the [grant application](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2292)
